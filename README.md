# News-Headlines-Creator

This was demoed to some of my students while I was a TA at IUPUI.

Trained on headlines scraped from major news outlets. Produces new unique headlines using an LSTM neural network.

speechAI.py creates the headlines. It has a built in sleep call on line 145, delete this if you want but you won't be able to keep up with it.
